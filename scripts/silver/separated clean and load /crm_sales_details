cleaning , transorming , loading data in silver.crm_sales_details 
________________________________________________________________________________________
1-normal stuff ( cheking unwanted spaces , if the foreing keys in the destination table , if there ay duplicates or nulls ) 
#issue there are  colums named dates sls_order_dt but having int valuse => type casting to date naissairy 
#issue there are colums having sls_order_dt = 0 / date in integer value 
# check if the order_dt < ship_date < due date  
##### correcting data form sls_sales , sls_price 
    - if the sale make no sense calculate it form quantity and price 
    - if the price make no sense calculate it from quantity and sales 
    ( we thinked that the quality table is okay !!)
    -### observed that there is also in isuue in the quantity table !!!!
    => handling it with if not  sales=quantity *price (and if sales/price are null/0/neg)  then quantity = sales/price 
### make transformation even if the data is okay ( if you make an update with new sources it handels it !)


    finally 
    - changing the ddl structue and inserting cleaned data
