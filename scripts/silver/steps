1-analyse bronze tabels ( understand data , relationships ( key , foreing key ) 
2- create exact same ddl tabes of bronze layer
3- add meta data for easy maintenance
_______________cleansing and transformation____cust_info___________________
4-understand the quality issues of every table [ check duplicated or null  primary key |using sql quieries)#row_number
5-cheking for unwanted spaces in string variabels 
6- standarizing/normalizing  the data f-> female m ->male 
7-adding derived colum ( upload date :dwh_creation_date)
________________________________________________prd_info_________________________
1--understand the quality issues of every table [ check duplicated or null  primary key
2-adding derived colum (cat_id and prd_key(form sls_details)  is a part from the prd_key)
3-resolving the relation issue erp_cat(HR_KH) crm_prd_cat(HR-kH) -> you should make data homogenirous
4-cheking for product with null or négative costs 
5## checking the dates because they make no sense ! 
{   -date_end<date_start ,
    -|bad solution (inverce end and start date ) =>interction entre date_end and date_start not null (in 2010 prd_x cost 14 and 12 at the same time ) 
}=> SOLUTION : delete end date and derived it from the start date so it didn't overlap #lead() => gives you the next row in the table ||lead(prd_start_dt)over(partition by prd_key ordred by prd_start_dt -1 AS prd_end

6- cleaning data make no sense in prd_start_dt 00:00:00:00 type DATETIME => Date : casting

### if there is any added meta data / corrected time => you should change the ddl to store that values
